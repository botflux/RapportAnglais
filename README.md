# My industrial placement

I was in placemen in media library Labs of Val dâ€™Argent, from May 29th 2017 to August 8th 2017 so 6 weeks.
How I got my placement?
Firstly, I focused my research on Web and software development companies. After some traineeship requests without any response, I finally requested the media library since I already done two placements for my Baccalaureat in their firm. *[REFORMULER ICI]*

# My point view:
The given work was enriching and coherent with my lessons. I was entirely satisfied with the working atmosphere. One of the best part was that I was discovering problems and resolution by myself.

My placement was benefit, because I applied my current knowledge in the Web development. I also discovered difficulties of web projects. My placement was also benefit for the media library since employees use the application I made. Thanks to this placement I also learntnew working process and tools.
