# My industrial placement

I was in placemen in media library Labs of Val dâ€™Argent, from May 29th 2017 to August 8th 2017 so 6 weeks.
How I got my placement?
Firstly, I focused my research on Web and software development companies. After some traineeship requests without any response, I finally requested the media library since I already done two placements for my Baccalaureat in their firm. [REFORMULER ICI]
